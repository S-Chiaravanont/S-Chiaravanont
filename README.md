### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chai -- just like Chai Tea. I'm an inspired web developer navigating through PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React & Node.js).

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my web application (pick-up-sports). It's a cool application for anyone looking to make new friends and join sport groups in your community. I've integrated Argon2 and JsonWebToken for authentication and multiple Google APIs (Maps, Autocomplete and Geocoding) to enrich user experience.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data structures and ways to improve my application database. I'm also learning Postgresql advanced queries technique including CTE and aggregate functions to modify my data and tables. If you have any tips and tricks or any helpful resources, please feel free to send them my way. I appreciate everyone's help and guidance.
