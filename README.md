### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chai -- just like Chai Tea. I'm a full-stack web developer/data engineer/software engineer/ex-civil engineer. My main technology stack is JavaScript, ReactJS, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, VueJS.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on foodie application where users can explore, learn and rate dishes from around the world. Users can find near by restaurants and play different ranking games.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning VueJS.

âš¡ Fun fact: Current activities I do weekly are bouldering and badminton. I love watching football (soccer) especially Premier League.
