### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chai -- just like Chai Tea. I'm a full-stack web developer/data engineer/software engineer/ex-civil engineer. My main technology stack is JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my new educational web application (on Civil Engineer/Formwork Engineering). It's a cool application for anyone looking to learn the basic of formwork such as pour pressure, tie load, bracing load. I want to learn and incorporate WebGL to showcase some key basic aspect of formworks.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning WebGL to up my frontend game.

âš¡ Fun fact: Current activities I do weekly are bouldering and badminton. I love watching football (soccer) especially Premier League.
